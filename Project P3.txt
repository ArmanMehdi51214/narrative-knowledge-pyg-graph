Project Title: The Unified Material & Physics Engine Goal: Create a "Rosetta Stone" Database that maps Real World Physics (Wikidata) to Game Items (Cataclysm: DDA) to create a mathematically balanced crafting economy.1. The ObjectiveWe need to generate a JSON library of items where every object has both Simulation Properties (Density, Melting Point) and Game Properties (Price, Utility, Crafting Difficulty).To do this, you will build a pipeline that ingests two disparate datasets and uses Vector Embeddings to figure out which items are the same (Entity Resolution).2. Data Sources (The Inputs)* Source A: The "Physics Truth" (Wikidata):  o Query for Chemical Elements (e.g., Iron, Carbon).  o Query for Common Materials (e.g., Steel, Wood, Plastic, Kevlar).  o Extract: Density, Melting Point, Tensile Strength, Thermal Conductivity.* Source B: The "Game Truth" (Open Source):  o Target: Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead (CDDA) (GitHub JSONs).  o Extract: Item Names, Base Weight, Volume, Price/Value, Material Tags, Crafting Recipes.3. The Core Tasks (The Complexity)Module A: The "Rosetta Stone" Matcher (NLP)* Challenge: Wikidata has "Ferrum" or "Wrought Iron." CDDA has "scrap_iron" or "iron_ingot."* Requirement: Use your Sentence Transformer pipeline to semantic-match Source A to Source B.* Logic:   o If similarity(vector_A, vector_B) > 0.85: Link them automatically.   o Create a "Merged Object" that inherits properties from both.Module B: The Constituent Decomposer (The "Deep" Part)* Challenge: We need to know what items are made of.* Requirement: Parse the CDDA JSON recipes.   o If Steel Sword is made of Steel Ingot...   o And Steel Ingot matches Wikidata Steel...   o Then Steel Sword inherits the Melting Point of Steel (1500¡C).* Output: Every item needs a constituents field (e.g., { "material_id": "mat_steel", "percentage": 1.0 }).Module C: The Scarcity Calculator (The Math)* Requirement: Implement a dynamic price formula field.   o calculated_price = (base_material_value * weight) * scarcity_modifier.   o (Note: You are defining the formula in JSON, not solving it yet, as Scarcity depends on the Map).4. The Output SchemaA single ledger_materials.json containing:JSON{  "id": "item_cdda_iron_bar",  "name": "Iron Bar",  "source_data": {    "cdda_id": "iron_bar",    "wikidata_id": "Q11415" // The NLP Match  },  "physics": {    "density": 7.8,         // From Wikidata    "melting_point": 1538,  // From Wikidata    "conductivity": "high"  },  "game_stats": {    "base_value": 5,        // From CDDA    "volume": 0.25,         // From CDDA    "tags": ["conductive", "ferrous"]  },  "constituents": {         // The Calculated Composition    "fe": 0.98,    "c": 0.02  }}Scope Clarification:* Input Volume: Please process the entire Cataclysm: DDA item library (approx. 10,000+ items).* Expected Yield: We do not have a fixed quota for matches, as we prioritize Quality (Similarity > 0.85) over quantity. However, we expect near-100% match rates for basic materials (e.g., Iron, Steel, Kevlar, Cotton, Water).
